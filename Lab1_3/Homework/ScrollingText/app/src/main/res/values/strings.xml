        I’ve played this song hundreds of times — with every band I’ve played in or with.
        <b>Woody Guthrie</b> recorded it with <b>Sonny Terry</b> (Saunders Teddell) on harmonica in 1940.
        Known also as “Lonesome Road Blues”, ”Down In The Jail On My Knees”, “Blowin’ Down This Road”,
        and “I Ain’t Gonna Be Treated This Way” among other titles, <b>this song</b> is probably best known
        for its cover by the Grateful Dead, although Garcia was known to favor a version by Delaney and Bonnie.
        See the <b><i>Song 3: Sonny Terry with Woody Guthrie, “Goin’ Down This Road Feelin’ Bad”</i></b> at
        www.rockument.com.\n\n

        For me, Woody’s is the original version, and Sonny Terry is the source of my harmonica style.
        You can hear Sonny whooping and hollering while playing harmonica, without stopping to take a breath.
        Sonny could make a harmonica walk and talk at the same time. He was a musical legend,
        a Piedmont blues musician, long-standing partner with Brownie McGhee,
        and a frequent collaborator with Woody.
        He was invited to play at Carnegie Hall for the first “From Spirituals to Swing” concert in 1938.
        Producer John Hammond supposedly went looking for Robert Johnson in the Deep South,
        found out he had been murdered, and discovered blind Sonny working the juke joints.
        Among many strange career highlights, Sonny appeared in the movie <i>The Color Purple</i>.\n\n

        He played acoustically, not directly on the  microphone as more modern blues players did (and still do),
        but with enough air between his harmonica and the mic so that you can hear the wah-wah effect
        of his hands as he cupped and opened them around his harmonica. I enjoy playing this way,
        because it is the same way as playing without a mic to a small audience without amplification.
        I also picked up the chugging tongue-clucking chords he used for rhythm.
